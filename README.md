# AWS Boto Scripts

A fork of [Hitesh's](http://hiteshbhatia.github.io/aws-boto-scripts/) aws boto scripts that I am extending. This requires a migration to 
`boto3` and making pep8 compliant. 

# Installation

Make sure you install a `virtualenv` and then `pip install -r requirements.txt` or

```
sudo pip install boto3
sudo pip install python-dateutil
```

# Contribute 

PR welcome. This is mostly extending these as needed for work, so I may not migrate all of these...
